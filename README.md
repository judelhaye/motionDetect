# Motion detector


A snippet I found on a linux magazine back in 2012, to which I added the ability to send an email notification

        pip install -r requirement.txt
        ./MotionDetectAdaptative 


Dependencies : 

- python
- python-opencv
- a camera

use your camera as a motion detector, can record a 10s video and 
send mail with a capture as attachment.

## TODO 

 * refacton this Frankenstein monster
 * gove it a more 2019ish flavor
 * finish email notification 
 * sms alerting
 * run as a daemon 
 * docker image
